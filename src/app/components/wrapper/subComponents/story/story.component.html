    Linkin Park is an American rock band from
    Agoura Hills, California. The band's current lineup
    comprises vocalist/rhythm guitarist/keyboardist
    Mike Shinoda, lead guitarist Brad Delson, bassist
    Dave Farrell, DJ/turntablist Joe Hahn and
    drummer Rob Bourdon, all of whom are founding
    members. Vocalists Mark Wakefield and Chester
    Bennington are former members of the band.

    while their later music features more electronica
    and pop elements.

    Formed in 1996, Linkin Park rose to international fame with their debut studio album, Hybrid Theory (2000), which
    became certified Diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Released during the peak of the nu
    metal scene, the album's singles' heavy airplay on MTV led the singles "One Step Closer", "Crawling" and "In the
    End" all to chart highly on the Mainstream Rock chart; the latter crossed over to the pop chart. Their second
    album, Meteora (2003), continued the band's success. The band explored experimental sounds on their third album,
    Minutes to Midnight (2007). By the end of the decade, Linkin Park was among the most successful and popular rock
    acts.
